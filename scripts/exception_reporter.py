Agent 3: Excel Results Email Sender
===================================
This agent finds and sends all generated Excel files from the product analysis pipeline.

Features:
- Finds all three main Excel files:
  1. sunfeast_product_analysis.xlsx (from Agent 1)
  2. sunfeast_merged_analysis.xlsx (from Agent 4)  
  3. qr_barcode_results_*.xlsx (from Agent 2 QR Orchestrator)
- Sends comprehensive email with all attachments
- Provides detailed file descriptions in email body
- Handles missing files gracefully
